The program takes in a user's Spotify refresh token to obtain data about the current track that the user is playing, if any. It then uses the data to get the album art of the current song playing. It then takes the album art and uses a special type of average to find the general color of the album art to change the user's LED lights to this color. In the case where no track is playing, the lights turn off, or if a track is playing but Spotify is unable to provide the album art of the track, the program just defaults to outputting white.
